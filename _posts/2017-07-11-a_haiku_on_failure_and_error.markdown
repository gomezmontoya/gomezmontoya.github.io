Amaze by the place of "failure" and "error" in the life of a programmer, I decided to amuse myself by composing a haiku. I recently spend sometime online with a technician discussing the 16 errors I was getting on the tic tac toe I was working on. I thought, there are few professions where error and failure are embraced. So, to cheer up those lonely programming souls, here is a haiku:


*Broken State*

A coder's doctrine (5)
invoke buddhist-like chaos (7)  
when error is bliss (5)
