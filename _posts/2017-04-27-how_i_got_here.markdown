It has ocurred to me that part of the task of teaching is also to commit to a lifetime of breaking or rethinking previous notions. In other words, I need to look elsewhere in order to come back to my purpose with a renewed perspective. I have been rethinking literature, language and culture courses at a time when study-abroad programs are closing and few students can afford to travel abroad. More importantly, I have been rethinking these courses at a time when technology is more accesible, less expensive, so that 99% of my students have a cell phone with the capability to do incredible things, including interacting with others through video, text, pictures, etc. We don't have so much technology in many classrooms, since education is so underfunded, yet most of us have cell phones and the ability to use them as a medium of effective communication and interaction with others. 

A few years back, I developed a couple of labs for my Translation course using podcasts; then, I collaborated on a pen-pal program with my intermediate Spanish class and an ESL class in Madrid using a wordpress site. A year later, I decided to sign up for a couple of classes at Harvard's Extension School and that is where I began to code. My favorite moment: seeing my ugly/crappy website I worked so hard to create, and having a bizarre sense of desbilief. I had done that all by myself. I had gone so far away from where my thinking roams, that my thinking was shifting.
