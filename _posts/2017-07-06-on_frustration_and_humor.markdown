I have decided to retire from teaching. I can code all day and all night if I want/can. According to my calculations, I would have to complete about 5 labs a day to make significant progress in July. (Day 1: Updated my system. 2 labs completed before noon. Plenty of time to reach the goal. 

I continue to think about how programming languages are constructed. I am interested in their mechanics. Objects that are like words, methods that work like statements and their returned values which are like the response to a statement. There are also symbols, punctuation and norms that make the language functional. Is an error much like a misunderstanding? A failure to make sense of a statement/message. Errors have become my best friend. But I hate them. Nonetheless, when you get 16 errors and 2 hours later you are down to 13, there's a sense of accomplishment... and of inevitable frustration. And that is very funny. 

Humor works on the limit of language. It profits from unexpected connections, sometimes from double meanings (which is like a momentary confusion) and often it is just a matter of tone. What is humor in programming languages?
